              In this game, you will have a set of items that you can craft together to create new items. You will be given a goal,
              which is an item you have to create.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Every item has a <strong>shape</strong> and a <strong>color</strong>.</li>
              <li>The shapes and colors of the items determine what they produce when you craft them together.</li>
              <li>Every combination of two items produces one item when crafted.</li>
              <li>The game will keep track of all the recipes you discover as you craft items together.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You can make new resources using the <strong>crafting bench</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>You can place any two resources on the crafting table with the "add" button and try to craft something with the "Craft!" button.</li>
              <li>The order of resources on the bench matters: placing the same two items in a different order might produce something different.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The game ends when you either produce your goal item or have only one item left in your inventory and can't craft anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will complete <strong>three games</strong>, each with different recipes and starting resources.
              You will complete <strong>{game.treatment.nEpisodes} "episodes"</strong> of the game, where your starting items and recipes will be the same,
              but you might have different goals.
            </p>
            <p>You will earn a <strong>bonus of {game.treatment.goalBonus}Â¢</strong> for every goal you accomplish.</p>
